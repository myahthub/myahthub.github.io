## Project description
In this project, I build a UDP client and server in C++. The client reads a file in 1000-byte chunks, marks each packet as “Data” or “Done,” and sends it to the server. The server creates a new file, writes each packet it receives, and responds after each one until the final “Done” packet completes the transfer.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
g++ server.cpp -o server
g++ client.cpp -o client

./server
./client
```

## UI Design
Focuses on creating clear, simple, and easy-to-use interfaces. My goal is to organize elements so users can navigate smoothly and complete tasks without confusion.

## 3. Additional Considerations

Ensuring the interface remains consistent, accessible, and responsive across different devices. I also make sure the layout supports user needs, loads efficiently, and maintains a clean, intuitive design throughout the project.
