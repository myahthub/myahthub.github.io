## Project description

For this assignment, I used Python and the Beautiful Soup library to practice web scraping. The Real Python tutorial (https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/) includes a “Keep Practicing” exercise where I had to take my web-scraping code and apply it to websites that use static HTML. From the list of suggested sites, I chose one and wrote a script that collects a list of jobs that might interest me.

To complete the project, I used the requests library to pull the webpage’s HTML and then used BeautifulSoup to parse the page and extract the information I needed. After my scraper collected the job titles, I saved the Python file to my GitHub so it can be viewed or downloaded. I also submitted the list of jobs I scraped into Blackboard as required.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./project
python setup.py
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
