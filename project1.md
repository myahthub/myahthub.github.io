## Project description

For this assignment, I used Python and the Beautiful Soup library to practice web scraping. The Real Python tutorial (https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/) includes a “Keep Practicing” exercise where I had to take my web-scraping code and apply it to websites that use static HTML. From the list of suggested sites, I chose one and wrote a script that collects a list of jobs that might interest me.

To complete the project, I used the requests library to pull the webpage’s HTML and then used BeautifulSoup to parse the page and extract the information I needed. After my scraper collected the job titles, I saved the Python file to my GitHub so it can be viewed or downloaded. I also submitted the list of jobs I scraped into Blackboard as required.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./project
python setup.py
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

For this project, I worked with a command-line interface (CLI) instead of a graphical user interface. A CLI is a type of user interface where the user interacts with the computer by typing commands rather than clicking buttons or navigating menus.

In my case, I used command lines to run my code, navigate files, and execute my Python web-scraping script. Even though it’s text-based, the CLI still counts as a form of UI because it provides a way for the user to interact with the system.

## 3. Additional Considerations

Using the command line comes with a few things to keep in mind. It can be harder at first because you have to remember commands instead of clicking buttons. Errors also show up as plain text, so you need clear instructions to understand what went wrong. Different computers use different command styles, and since the command line can do powerful things, you have to be careful not to run anything that could mess up your system.
